__Spoof Proof__
===========

> The police have retrieved a network trace of some suspicious activity. Most of the traffic is users viewing their own profiles on a social networking website, but one of the users on the network downloaded a file from the Thyrin Labs VPN and spoofed their IP address in order to hide their identity. Can you figure out the last name of person that accessed the Thyrin files, and the two source IP addresses they used?

----------

Open up this [`pcap`][pcap] file in [Wireshark] to analyze it.

Let's think about this problem. The users are viewing their own profiles on some website, but one use downloaded a file and spoofed their IP address to make it look like there were coming from elsewhere. 

So all the things we care about interact with a website, so we want to see things under [HTTP]. And, they are all just viewing pages, so they should clearly be [GET requests]. With all this information, we can filter very easily! 

In [Wireshark], I used the filter `http contains "GET"`. This trimmed the number packets down to just five. Makes for easy analysis!

The last packet shows the user grabbing that file, the `secretfile.txt`. Now we just need to figure out who it was that downloaded this file. We know the [IP Address] is wrong, because it has been spoofed... but we can identify a machine by other means than its [IP address]: we can look at its [MAC Address]. 

[Wireshark] will display a source or destination [MAC Address] in the display of the packet headers. Under the link layer section of the headers, the [MAC Address] is what is displayed in parentheses.

So for our `secretfile.txt` download, the [MAC Address] of the machine sending the [GET request] looks to be `08:00:27:2b:f7:02`, right? Now all we have to do is find another packet transfer with that same source [MAC Address]. We only have four options, so this should be extremely easy to find.

You should find that the [GET request] transfer for `john.johnson` has that same [MAC Address]. Now we have all the information we need; the lastname of the user, his original [IP address], and his spoofed [IP address]!
