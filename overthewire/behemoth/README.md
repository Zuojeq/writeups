__Behemoth__
================

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding levels released by the [OverTheWire] online practice wargames under the wargame [Behemoth].

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!

Description
---------------------


> Description:
> This wargame deals with a lot of regular vulnerabilities found commonly 'out 
> in the wild'. While the game makes no attempts at emulating a real environment
> it will teach you how to exploit several of the most common coding mistakes 
> including buffer overflows, race conditions and privilege escalation.

> Behemoth’s levels are called behemoth0, behemoth1, … etc. and can be accessed on behemoth.labs.overthewire.org through SSH.

> To login to the first level use:

> Username: behemoth0
> Passowrd: behemoth0

> Data for the levels can be found in /behemoth/.
