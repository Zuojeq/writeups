__Natas :: Level 0__
================

```
There is no information for this level, intentionally.
```

----------


Start by [`ssh`][ssh]ing into the level.

```
ssh leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org
```

If you run the [`ls`][ls] command, you'll see there is nothing in the home directory. But the wargame prompt says, "Data for the levels can be found in the homedirectories. You can look at /etc/leviathan_pass for the various level passwords."

So what the heck? 

You can pass the `-a` flag to the [`ls`][ls] command for it to display ALL files, including hidden files. From there you'll find a `.backup` directory, which looks pretty peculiar.

If you `cd` into that directory and [`ls`][ls] again, you'll find this [`bookmarks.html`](bookmarks.htmlk) file. If you [`cat`][cat] this, you'll notice it's pretty hefty. 

It seems like this is all we have to work with. So, let's go ahead and peruse through the file. We could look through it manually, but, well, we know we're looking for a "password", right? Our goal is the password for the next level.

So, just for potty words and giggles, what if we [`grep`][grep] that file for "password"? 

Check it out.

```
cat bookmarks.html | grep "password"
<DT><A HREF="http://leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/passwordus.html | This will be fixed later, the password for leviathan1 is rioGegei8m" ADD_DATE="1155384634" LAST_CHARSET="ISO-8859-1" ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A>
```

Mmmm, looks like we got it!

__The password for leviathan1 is `rioGegei8m`.__
