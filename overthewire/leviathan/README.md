__Leviathan__
================

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding levels released by the [OverTheWire] online practice wargames under the wargame [Leviathan].

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!

Description
---------------------


> Description:
> This wargame does not require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common
> sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands. We had no idea that it would be this
> hard to make an interesting wargame that would nott require programming abilities from 
> the players. Hopefully we made an interesting challenge for the new ones.

> Leviathan’s levels are called leviathan0, leviathan1, … etc. and can be accessed on leviathan.labs.overthewire.org through SSH.

> To login to the first level use:

> Username: leviathan0
> Password: leviathan0

> Data for the levels can be found in the homedirectories. You can look at /etc/leviathan_pass for the various level passwords.
