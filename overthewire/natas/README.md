__Natas__
================

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding levels released by the [OverTheWire] online practice wargames under the wargame [Natas].

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!

Description
---------------------


> Description:
> Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

> Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

> Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5.

> Start here:

> Username: natas0
> Password: natas0
> URL:      http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
