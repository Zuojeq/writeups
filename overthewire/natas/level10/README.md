Once again we are supplied with an input box and source code

By examining the source code it becomes apparent this problem is almost exactly like level9, however the `;` is one of the forbidden characters.

`$key` is still where your command will execute, however we can't terminate the grep that comes before it.

Instead of terminating it, lets use a [regular expression] (regex) to change the grep into something valuable to us.

submit the command `.* /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 #`

The difference between level9 and level 10 is the `.*`

The `.` means look for any character and the `*`means "that occurs 0 or more times"

This will look for any string beginning with the path `/etc/natas_webpass/natas10`

(Seriously, read the regex link)

Voil√† out pops the flag
