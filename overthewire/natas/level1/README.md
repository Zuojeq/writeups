Start by using a web browser to navigate to the website `http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org/`

```
Login: natas1

Password: gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto
```

You'll see a text banner "You can find the password for the next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!"

Cool, well I'm going to do what I did for the last challenge, `ctrl + u` and we win again.

You will see:

<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi -->

Looks like this web hacking stuff isn't too bad, right?
