----------


Start by using a web browser to navigate to the website `http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/`

You'll be greeted with with the text banner "You can find the password for the next level on this page."

Now your probably thinking "my eyes work fine and I don't see any passwords," and you would be correct.

This challenge introduces you to the html source code for a page. You can find this through a couple of methods
```
1. ctrl + u (This is, in my opion, the most useful for this problem)
2. Right Click` select `Inspect Element
```
Using 1. you will immediately see the password for the next level:

<!--The password for natas1 is gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto -->
