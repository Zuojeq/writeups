Log in as usual to the account with the password you retrieved from the previous level.

```
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

You can run [`ls`][ls] as usual to see what is in the current directory, and we do of course see the `-` file.

Normally, [`cat`][cat] would be the command we run to view the contents of a file. And _it still is_... but this file is designed to be tricky.

When we run `cat -`, nothing is displayed; we can type stuff and hit enter, but then whatever we write is displayed back at us (you can hit `Ctrl+C` to break out of that).

As it turns out, the `-` symbol (hyphen) is a symbol interpreted in [bash] to refer to [standard input][standard streams]. If you check out the [man page] for the [`cat`][cat] program, it is supposed to be 'concatenate files and print on the standard output'. Since everything in [Linux] is a file, that [standard input][standard streams] stream will just print out what you type in.

So just like other symbols, like how `~` refers to your [home directory], `*` refers to a wildcard, `.` refers to your current directory, `-` just refers to the [standard input][standard streams] stream. Even try running [`nano`][nano], a [command-line] text editor. 

```
john@john-Latitude-E7440:~$ nano -
Reading from stdin, ^C to abort
```

If you don't believe me, even [`nano`][nano] will tell you!

So how do we check out the file? 

Well, we could access it with an [absolute][absolute path] or relative path. Any of these commands would do it:

* `cat ~/-`
* `cat /home/bandit1/-`
* `cat ./-` (as long as you are in the [home directory] for the user)

You've got to indicate the filename in such a way that the shell does not consider it to be the symbol for the [`standard input`][standard streams].
