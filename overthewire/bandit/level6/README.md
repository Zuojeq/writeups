__Bandit :: Level 6__
================


_John Hammond_ | _Thursday, November 12th, 2015_ 


> The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties: - owned by user bandit7 - owned by group bandit6 - 33 bytes in size


----------


Log in as usual to the account with the password you retrieved from the previous level.

```
ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

The challenge description tells us the file is __somewhere on the server__. So we've got to look everywhere. Since the file structure is kind of like a tree, and the [`find`][find] command works by running through branch by branch, we've got to start searching at the _root_ of the tree: the root of the filesystem, `/`. A forward-slash denotes the uppermost-level of a [Linux] filesystem, often called the 'root' directory.

You could either `cd` there, or just pass it in to the [`find`][command] as an argument. I'll do the latter.

If you read the [manpage] of the [`find`][find] command very carefully, you should very easily be able to piece together what command we need to run to find our file.

```
bandit6@melinda:~$ find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6
```

The bigger problem here is how to get rid of all these `Permission Denied` notifications. We can't see which file we're actually looking for because we keep getting flooded by that error message.

Since that _is_ an error, we know that is being displayed to [standard error][standard streams], one of the [standard streams]. [Standard error][standard streams] actually is referenced by the number 2, so we _could_, potentially, just redirect that somewhere else in order to make it go away. If we direct to it the `/dev/null` device, it'll just disappear.

Now we can clearly see the file that has our password. 

```
bandit6@melinda:~$ find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

We [`cat`][cat] that out, and we're all done!

__The password for bandit7 is `HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs`.__
