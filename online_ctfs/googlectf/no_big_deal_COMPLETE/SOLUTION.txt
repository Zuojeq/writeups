Took some serious hunting in the packets through Wireshark. I filtered through the NBD protocol, and after some perusing through the data I found something interesting in packet #76. I could this weird string in the middle of the data... and it looked like base64: 


>>> import base64 as b
>>> b.b64decode('Q1RGe2JldHRlcmZzLnRoYW4ueW91cnN9')
'CTF{betterfs.than.yours}'
>>> 


CTF{betterfs.than.yours}
