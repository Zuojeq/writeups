This took a lot longer than it really should have.

I ran `strings` on the initial `illintentions.apk`, and did find the string `git_user`. After some more hunting, I saw the string `l33tdev42`. That looked promising. I searched `github.com` for that username, found him, and then cloned his only repository `testApp`. This all looked promising. I ran a simple `grep` search through all the files to try and find the flag, but that didn't work.

So next I tried `git log` to see all the commits. Nothing in there either, but there was one stating that the author removed the password. Okay... so next I tried `git show`. Found the flag there!
