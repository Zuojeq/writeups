Cricket
1730...?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1730_English_cricket_season
============
 As was generally the case through the 1720s in the time of its noted patron Edwin Stead, the "ChampionCounty" per se would have been Kent.By process of elimination using the known results, Kent seems tohave been the strongest county team in 1730. Surrey had beaten Middlesex early in the season but losttwice to London in August. London played Kent three times: one result is unknown, one was apparently adraw (arguably the earliest known drawn game) and the other was won by Kent. The drawn game betweenKent and London is significant in this. The St James Evening Post on Saturday, 8 August reported: "'Twasthought that the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being beat at one innings if time hadpermitted". This is the first time that a team is called the "champions" while "losing their honours" suggestsloss of a title.
