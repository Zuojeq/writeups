__HackIM 2016 :: Programming Question 2__
==================================

_John Hammond_ | _Sunday, January 31st, 2016_ 


> Your simple good Deeds can save you but your GREED can kill you. This has happened before. This greedy person lived a miserable life just for the greed of gold and lust. You must know him, once you know him, you must reach his capital and next clues will be given by his famous EX-Body Guard. This file consists of few paragraphs. Each paragraph singles out one Alphabet. Scrambling those Aplphabets will help you to know the country of this Ruler. Who was this Ruler?

----------

This challenge was really cryptic, so for a good while we didn't really know what to do. 

[Here is a copy of the given file](TheLastRuler.txt):

```
along with azalaan, country has became a major tourist attraction, with as many landmarks as Paris, such as Great Tribal Pyramid and  3,000 year old statue of the Gold Fartility Go it has a recast as a statue of Haffaz azalaan due to public outcry. Due to the lack of foreign investment, azalaann has attempted to offer 400,000 square miles of desert land to countries wishing to test missiles or to dump chemical waste.

lion is 1 of the 5 n live big cats, lives in the long parallel Panthera family Fellidae. Commonlly used term African lion collectively denotes several clubs found in Africa. With some males of 250 kg (550 lb)  weight, lion the second-largest living cat. Wild lions currentlly exist in sub-Saharan Africa and  Asia (large n legally protected popullation resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions pulled up popullation from North Africa.

This is the first time word "innings" is found in records.

```

For a long while (a straight 12 hours) we ended up researching these paragraphs and actually trying to find the website that they came from. It seemed like that wasn't really getting us anywhere... and the challenge prompt makes no sense, so we didn't really know what the heck to do.

Eventually we had the idea of counting all the occurences of the letters. Maybe in the challenge prompt whenever it said "alphabet" it was referring to some character, and how it "singles out" one "alphabet" may be the most common character.

It was a worthy idea, so we thought we'd try it. It was easy enough in [Python] with the [`collections`] module and the [`Counter`] object.

[Here's the code](show_characters.py):

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from collections import Counter

text = '''

'''

paragraphs = text.split("\n")

for p in paragraphs:
	print Counter(p)
```

Just a simple loop to show the common characters for each paragraph; that's really all we needed, it didn't have to be clean. Aside from the space character, we were able to see the most common characters that were `a`, `l`, `i`, `b`, and `y`. Do we know any countries with those letters...?

___Oh!___ __Libya!__

I was able to literally [Google] "bad ruler libya" and then I got the name of the ruler, and the flag. 


__The flag is `muammar gaddafi`.__
