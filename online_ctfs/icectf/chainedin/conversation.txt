Had you gotten the ChainedIn challenge as well? I know you're good with web ahaha
haha not well
yes i got it
I can log in with that agent1568 user, but I don't entirely see how that helps us
I can see the like AJAX/JavaScript log in, though, so I couldn't tell if it is like serverside javascript I need to run?
no
ths is SQLi Blind MongoDB
MongoDb
AngularJS Requests
try burp suite and do that
like it:
{"user":"$gt", "pass:"$gt"}}
you will do that:
{"user":"admin", "pass":{"$regex": ".{55}"}}
passwd have 55 chars
and write python script for exploit it !
and will get the flag !
try to read about AngularJS and SQLi Blind MongoDB
this is my script:
http://pastebin.com/MrXC1Swr
#!/usr/bin/python import requests table="" url="http://chainedin.vuln.ic - Pastebin.com
pastebin.com
after do this angularjs requests:
{"user": {"$ne": "agent1568"},"pass": {"$gt": "%s"}}
do that in burp suite and see the results
"WELCOME Admin"
and wrote it as a data variable in my script
and got tha flag ðŸ™‚
Hmmm, okay, cool. I'll give it a try, thanks
I've seen the "$gt" mongodb attack before but never put it in action
Thanks!
welcome!
