once upon a time there was a young hacker called m
it was the sixties they were trying to figure out how to
in those days your only option was reading large books and
trying to learn how to program and spend a lot 
of time punching those can you image what could
errors due to small and mostly insignicant mistakes but
how to properly write secure code in those languages
use those punch cards they like stop program in fortran
that will take more time to debug and figure out where is
the bugs but those were the old days can you find the flag

happening if you make small mistakes in one of the punched 
cards after those hours with results then its
using this old technology good luck you will need it no

she likes to program in fortran
