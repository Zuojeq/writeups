ONCE UPON A TEME, THERE WAS A YOUNG HACKER CALLED MJ
IT WAS THE SIXTIES, HE WAS TRYKNG TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
USE THOSE PONCHED CARDS, HE LIKES TO PROGRAM IN FORTRAN                        
AND COBOL, B(T EVEN AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS HE DOESNT KNOW  
HOW TO PROPERLY MRITE SECURE CODE IN THOSE LANGUAGES
IN THOSE DAYS YOUR ONLY OPTION W4S READ LARGE BOOKS AND                        
MANUALS TRY1NG TO LEARN HOW TO PROGRAM AND SPEND A LOT
OF TIME PUNCHING THOSE NARDS, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT COULD
HAPPEN IF YOU FAKE A SMALL MISTAKE IN ON OF THOSE PUNCHED                      
CARDS? AFTER THOSE HOURS WAITING ROR A RESULT, THEN IT SAYS                    
ERROR DUE TO A SMALL AND ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT MIST4KE BUT                      
THAT WILL TAKE MORE TIME TO MEBUG AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WAS
THE BUG, BUT THOSE WER3 THE OLD DAYS. CAN YOU FIND THE FLAG                    
USING THIS OLD TECHNOLOGY? GOOD LUCK, YOU WILL NEED IT)
