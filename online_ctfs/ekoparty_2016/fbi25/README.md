They gave us a [URL], so I tried to navigate to that domain [`https://silkroadzpvwzxxv.onion`](https://silkroadzpvwzxxv.onion), but it "was not found."

I had never seen a `.onion` domain before, [so I decided to do some research](https://www.deepdotweb.com/how-to-access-onion-sites/) and find out what they really are.

Apparently, you can't access those web pages without using the [Tor Browser]. So, I had to download it!

I was able to install it with just the [64-bit][64-bit] [Linux] installer. I just clicked it within the file explorer honestly, and it did everything for me. Then I was able to open up the browser just by clicking it again.

Now I could go to the website.

It was simple, just a log in form. To make sure I didn't miss anything, I viewed the source of the webpage `Ctrl+U`... and there was the flag, at the very top of the source, in an [HTML] comment.
