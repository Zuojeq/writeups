__32C2 CTF__
===========================

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding challenges that we as a Cyber Team solved while participating in the online competition [32C3 CTF].

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!

Funny enough, we actually only solved one problem with this [CTF]; that put is in 212th place out of 389 registered teams (but we were tied for 176th place, with that). To top it off, there were literally 213 other teams in the same spot we were in. 389 - 176 = those 213 teams that only solved one challenge. That's _over half_ of the registered teams.

Needless to say, this was a _difficult_ [CTF]!
