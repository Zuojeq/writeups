For this [CTF] we finished in 197th place out of 1031. Our two rival teams finished in 45th place and 72nd place, but we were still pleased with our performance. We did finish in the top 20%, and this was the first online [CTF] where we were put on excusal and had everyone spend dedicated time during their Saturday to participate. Even some VIPs came and visited to see the game!
