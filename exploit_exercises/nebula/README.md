--------------------

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding levels released by the [Exploit Exercises] online practice wargames under the wargame [Nebula].

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!

> In case you need root access to change stuff (such as key mappings, etc), you can do the following:

Log in as the “nebula” user account with the password “nebula” (both without quotes), followed by “sudo -s” with the password “nebula”. You’ll then have root privileges in order to change whatever needs to be changed.
