__Smash the Stack__
================

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding challenges released by the [Smash the Stack] online practice wargames.

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!
