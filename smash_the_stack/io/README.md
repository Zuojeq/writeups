__IO__
================

The purpose of this directory and its sub-directories is to contain any information regarding levels released by the [Smash the Stack] online practice wargames under the wargame [IO].

The hope with this repository and this specific directory is that users will have a place to post resources, scripts, solution writeups, and any other material that may relate to solving some challenges. If a problem does not have some of your input, whether or not it some code or even a full-blown writeup and solution, feel free to add something!

Description
---------------------


> This is the frontpage of the IO wargame, one of the wargames of the smashthestack network. Now with added radare2. IO is our most mature game, it has however produced two children in various stages of development. io64, and ioarm. Running natively on x86_64 and ARMv7 respectively.
Connection Details

> You have to use an ssh client to connect to the game.

> ```
> ssh level1@io.smashthestack.org
> password: level1
> ```
>
> You can find help and guidance on our irc channel: #io. Connect to our irc network over at irc.smashthestack.org . Even if you don't need our help, you are welcome to drop by and socialize. (Note: you can _not_ use the webclient on the main page to join the #io channel). The game is still in development and levels get added regularly. You can also still reach ssh on port (2224) and httpd on port 84, or 433 over ssl.

> After solving a level you can add a piece of text to the tags file. This file shows up on this webpage, using the links below. Feel free to be somewhat creative. However keep it civil, we do not want to have to police these files. It's probably a good idea to disable javascript when browsing the links below!
